Your task will be to build a classifier that can determine whether a sample is malignant or benign to help your colleague!\n","\n","Every patient that arrives at the hospital undergoes a biopsy of their tumor. This means that a small sample of the tumor is taken from the patient and various metrics are recorded about it, including: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.\n","\n","Using a large dataset of labeled biopsy samples from breast cancer tumors, you will build your binary classification model to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on these features.

These cells are part of a tumor biopsy where the extracted tissue is sampled with a special needle. The cells are subsequently stained with different dyes to help visualize their shapes, quantity of DNA, etc. These properties provide clues and insight into the rate of cell division (Rapid cell division = Cancerous).\n"," ### Optional: Data Feature Descriptions\n","\n","Our dataset reports 10 different features of the biopsies. Here's what a few of them mean:\n","\n","1. $Perimeter$: Total distance between points defining the cell's nuclear perimeter.\n","2. $Radius$: Average distance from the center of the cell's nucleus to its perimeter.\n","3. $Texture$: The texture of the cell nucleus is measured by finding the variance of the gray scale intensities in the component pixels.\n","4. $Area$: Nuclear area is measured by counting the number of pixels on the interior of the nucleus and adding one-half of the pixels in the perimeter.\n","\n","The following image should give a visual to what these cell nucleus features look like:\n","\n","![perimeter](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-U43OAojYbMY9gIlpvLHPNr3V2saqqHJ)\n","\n","5. $Smoothness$: Measures the smoothness of a nuclear contour by measuring the difference between the length of a radial line and the mean length of the lines surrounding it. The image below demonstrates this:\n","\n","![smoothness](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1oVGDbMi1R23i_dpMsimb3VV3_wrsQG-Q)\n","\n","6. $Concavity$: Measures the severity of concavities or indentations in a cell nucleus. Chords are drawn between non-adjacent snake points and measure the extent to which the actual boundary lies inside each chord. The line in bold in the image below is an example of a chord.\n","\n","![concavity](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1svQHoeu1wKMAnum33lgvSNppx2GVsuKX)\n","\n","7. $Symmetry$: The major axis (longest chord) through the center is found.
